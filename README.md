# Falling Without Style
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2024

## Theme - Reverse
The way our group interpreted the theme was that you are a robot falling into a mine and you need to avoid the gold and hit all the obstacles to 'lose' the most points and win the game. This is an inverse on typical game rules and style for score and games of this type where the goal is to collect coins and avoid obstacles. 

## Game Play
Objectives:
* Hit as many objects as you can
* Avoid the gold
* Make it to the bottom of the mine with the lowest score possible
* Click continue to start falling!
* Get the least amount of score as possible

Controls:

* D = Move right
