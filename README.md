# Falling Without Style
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2024

## Theme - Reverse
The way our group interpreted the theme was that you are a robot falling into a mine and you need to avoid the gold and hit all the obstacles to 'lose' the most points and win the game. This is an inverse on typical game rules and style for score and games of this type where the goal is to collect coins and avoid obstacles. 

## Game Play
Objectives:
* Hit as many objects as you can
* Avoid the gold
* Make it to the bottom of the mine with the lowest score possible
* Click continue to start falling!
* Get the least amount of score as possible

Controls:
* A = Move left
* D = Move right

## Impediments
A lot of our major struggles for this game was trying to figure out GitHub for when Brett and Brenden were working on the build at the same time. We had a moment when we had to push a new movement script Brenden created which had edits to the main level, but Brett had already started on Level Design for it. We ended up just pushing the script, and added the parts after. There was also a few issues importing assets, but we mangaged to figure that out without too much struggle. The biggest thing was desigining a movement system from scratch, which we didn't expect to do intitally. Overall though we didn't have a lot of major struggles fortunately.
